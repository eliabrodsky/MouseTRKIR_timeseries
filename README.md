The Pheno-Tracker Continuous Monitoring system offers a highly sensitive non-invasive method to monitor external disease symptoms in animal models of human disease. The system combines hardware and software and generates detailed digital data in near-real time, showing time-course information on animal activity,  tracking physiological changes in near real time. The system utilizes a wide range of sensors for highly detailed monitoring. These data are analyzed for changes in external physiology and behavior over the course of an experiment to characterize disease onset, model its development over time and predict disease outcome at early stages, even before clinical manifestations.
